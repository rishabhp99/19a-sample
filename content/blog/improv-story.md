**"Look, I know you hate this, but we need at least one good photo of you."**

"No photographs!" The man was yelling.

They had tried everything, from stern persuasion to brute force. This was going to be difficult. The clinically insane were always difficult.

Officer Brandon carefully approached the convict. "For the hundredth time," he said, "This is not a conspiracy to leak your face to the alien overlords. It's a mugshot, required by law. Just stay still!"

"No photographs!" The man shouted again, cowering.

Officer Brandon sighed. This was going to be difficult indeed.

Officer Brandon did sigh 

On this inexplicable problem, 

But he had to try, 

To get Ron’s mugshot done. 

Alas he told him a secret, 

Even if it was a web of lies, 

“Alien overlords do not harm convicts” 

Hoping that this Ron buys.

Brandon then took out a block, 

Something vague seeming unearthly. 

He started in it a crazy talk,

Speaking gibberish fiercely.

Ron could only stand by and watch in pure horror as the block talked back. The clicks of communication turned frantic when Officer Brandon started melting. His skin: dripping just like candle wax on the cold linoleum floor of the asylum. 

Drip. Drip. Drip.

Dripped: a puddle, laid the officer below

The floor’s gleam of skin reflecting Ron’s confused state.

Smirking ugly, sniggered the talking block

At Ron the scrawny hands, pointed, “checkmate.”

Like something out of a Courage: The Cowardly Dog episode, the puddle began to reform. As Ron watched in horrified silence, a being with two grotesque faces materialized. It had two arms branching from one shoulder, and a third jutting from what Ron assumed was a stomach. 

The block cackled in glee.

A sudden tremor ran through the building. A roar from behind him was all Ron heard before the wall exploded. He ducked under a bed as debris fell around him. The cackling ceased. 

"Ron, come on! We're blowing this joint!" yelled a familiar voice. 

Ron crawled out to see Ronnie waving an RPG from the back of a pickup truck, with his friend, Brock, in the driver's seat.

Brock drifted towards Ron, "Hop on, we're breaking you out!"

Ron took one look back at the horrific monster before getting on. This was WAY more than a photograph now.

Ronnie was shook. "What the fuck is that?!” he asked. 

Ron replied "How am I supposed to know? Fucking blast it, let's get outta here!" 

Ronnie sighed, loading his RPG, but it was too late by then. The monster cracked open Ronnie’s skull. 

Ron screamed. "Floor it! Let’s go!”

The ground rumbled with every step the monster took, making it nearly impossible for Brock to focus on the road.

"Damn it," he swore under his breath. This was the kind of situation he had been training for his entire life, but now that it was here, he felt almost paralyzed. Ronnie would've mocked him for his weakness if he were alive.

But Ronnie was dead, and the show must go on. 

But the show couldn't go on because his fingers were freezing up. His neck was stiff, his jaw clenched, cementing his teeth together. His legs were locked in place. He couldn't move an inch, couldn’t shift his fingers. His eyes were the only things he could move - left to right, right to left. 

No amount of training had ever prepared him for this. Especially since training is just that: not real.

“Snap out of it, man! Where in God's name are we headed? We'll miss the portal to the Axeclor Dimension if you don’t switch to aerial mode! Get your head in the game!” Ron yelled.

Brock sighed. Looks like Ron would be of no use for a while. 

He turned to tell Ron to shut the hell up, but only had time to widen his eyes before Ron slammed the big purple button on the dashboard.

“You goddamn IDIOT! How dare you turn on the radio?”

“What? A situation like this requires a boss battle theme playing in the background!’

The last thing Brock needed was a metal band screeching while was dodging a monster. But such was the nature of life. 

“Watch out!”

The monster had caught up to them with a spectacular high jump. Brock took a sharp right turn and crashed into the front door of a theatre.

“That jump was a perfect 10,” sighed Ron.

Brock got out of the truck, coughing. They had lost the monster, for now. This was their only chance to come up with a plan before the creature found them. 

Ron was taking deep breaths. “Brock,” he said, “One of us needs to go back there." 

At this, Brock slammed Ron up against the door, holding him by the collar.

“We got ourselves into heaps of trouble getting you out of there. Ronnie DIED for you, and now, you want to go back to the same place? Are you out of your mind?"

Ron pushed Brock off. “It ain’t that,” he said, smoothening his collar. “The block made a man melt and form a monster. Who knows if there are more? There is only one way to find out, Brock. Please." 

Brock looked out of the window. There was no way they could get past the monster. Unless…

“Please, Brock. You know I’m right.”

Brock groaned. "Alright, have it your way. But you're never gonna get past him without me. I’ll do my best to create a distraction. Pray for me. Go, go!”

Before they could do anything, the ground began rumbling. Looked like Ron sucked at praying.

Brock was no athlete, but the speed at which he and Ron ran outside put cheetahs to shame. The truck was a wreck. The monster was ambling towards them now. That left the two men no option but to run again.

After what seemed like hours, they realized that the monster had stopped following them. They found an abandoned trailer at the side of the road. With nowhere else to go, they decided to make themselves at home here. Exhaustion overtook Brock and Ron as they passed out on the floor.

A soft knock woke them up.

knock knock

knock knock

“Who’s there?” asked Ron.

“Ya”

“Ya who?”

“Yahoo! I found you! Hahaha” said the being outside the trailer.

“Oh no, it was a lame joke. Get outta here” laughed Ron.

“Let me try one more time, please.” knock knock

“Who’s there?” Ron answered.

“Candice”

“Candice who?”

“Candice door open, or what? Hahaha,” chuckled the voice outside.

Ron giggled. 

He turned towards Brock and found him looking sternly. “I’m going to unfriend you on Facebook now. I can’t have friends who laugh at jokes like that, said Brock pulling out his phone. 

Meanwhile the monster outside the door continued laughing.

The talking block sighed, perching precariously on the monster's third hand.

"Brandon," (for that was the monster's name), "if all you wanted was to make friends, you needn't have killed Ronnie."

"That was supposed to be a trust-building exercise!"

"Cracking a man's skull open?"

"I was only trying to pat his head! I underestimated my strength."

The magic block sighed. For years, its purpose had been to help lonely monsters make friends. Insane people were the easiest to befriend because of their willingness to believe everything.

Brandon had caused the first casualty in a career spanning six centuries.

Everyone stared at Ramlal in amazement as he told them the greatest story they'd ever heard. With the only movement being the passing of the joint around the circle, the night went on to be one they would never forget.
