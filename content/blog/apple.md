She lay awake, clutching her dead dad's portrait,

her mind wavering over the 10 pm headlines she saw,

' Serial Killer Bill escapes from prison. '

Just then, taps erupted, distorting the dreaded silence.

They were not the stealthy treads of a thief,

It was the echo of a firm footstep, proclaiming its arrival.

She crawled underneath a pile of blankets,

as the steps inched closer and closer.

She heard a pounding; Was it the door? No, it was her heart.

The door creaked open slowly, as a dark figure emerged from it.

A ghastly stench of flesh and rot filled the room.

Blood drops were slithering across the figure's torn shirt.

"Did he hurt mommy? I have to save her!" She thought.

But fear confined her limbs to the bed, choking her lungs slowly.

The dark figure stood, sniffing around like a bloodhound.

The moonlight quaintly emerged, illuminating its face.

Amidst its malicious eyes and blood-stained mouth,

She saw a face, too strangely familiar. It was "Da...d? "

The figure stared at her, licking its hungry lips,

" Dessert!!" it groaned. The light went out, but the screams did not.

Apple just like her name, was a sweet kid,

but the monster was not.

It devoured her, boring into her body until

all that was left, was her half-eaten body and her bobby pin.
