Four thousand, two hundred and thirty-six kilometres away, a shrimp-seller catches a cold.

Three months and four days later, I am confined to my home.

And from there, it is only paranoia: a sneeze is no longer greeted with a blessing and coughs are the sermons of the devil. Warm skin only makes the blood run cold.

The worst is the silence. 

It rings from every house, from every shop, from every place that was once alive with noise - now still, so still, like Life has her hands over her mouth - no, stop that now, it is illegal.

Something about this makes me weep. 

And then it begins: the soft apocalypse.

The swans come home to Venice, returning home from a war that lasted sixty years; Beijing nights are illuminated by stars, a sight truly seen only once in a blue moon.

My scooter is entwined in vines. 

There are mountains around it, or are they molehills? I cannot tell the difference anymore; does it really matter?

Today, I woke up to a robin calling out to his mate, and my heart sang with him.

 Suddenly, there's music everywhere - from the eagles circling my rooftop; from the crickets chirping at my windowsill; from the murder of crows making a killing out of discarded food, the rot feeding life here.

Not all music is made my humans. 

And happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.
