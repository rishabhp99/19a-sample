Damsels in distress: *not*.

*Nor* the sugar & spice, plethora of 

all things *nice*;

Fellow being, just like yourself

I too lie with a *soul*, some scattered *flesh*.

Flesh, you see peeking off of; like thieves

*Coward* like thieves**-** on the *other side* of the screen;

Brother or Father is not what you go by,

To trade yourself with some respect of mine.
*Then why must I?* 

Call it a fuming plea, *a hoax-*

concerned at the leasts for me:

Me & my fellow Queens, I speak for

For you seem to have forgotten, the wildfire

we take after, *aglow*:

amidst your puddle of filth & dirty shows:

Is made up of fire & forceful stories

You thought, would never be taught.

Albeit, *oops,* here we are.

*Now, precious little monster, on the other side of the screen:*

run, as fast as you can- from that *scum* intellect of yours

before I, *we*, devour you *whole*.

For all you may try, & do is start a flimsy *war*,

*But we?* Weâ€™d win them all.
