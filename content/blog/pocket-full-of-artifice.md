Deception: is all that glimmers

Amidst the colossal horde of souls,

many lost, most**:** deceased;

Dished in gloom

And served with armaments of 

Pretence; garnished, to the core.

An art that is well-taught to them,

From the ages of raw.

I too am a craftsman, proficient in this field.

Just like you or, them.

In the storylines packed with chicanery

Narrated to the ones we loathe,

Albeit, it’s us who fall prey

Betraying none: but ourselves the most.

Why, you enquire? 

Because, of all that

They’ve used against me

Words of mine have proven the most lethal:

Gentleness**-** being mistaken 

for, weakness.

Thus, I refine my facade as I learn

The less I speak, the lesser I’ll burn

“It**’**s poker, baby!**”

The more you come to *know* me,

The more you never will. 

The scars I bore, with all my heart--

defective & soft; for a world too forbidding

wishing to be seen

Only to be hidden

Like the tricks up my sleeves,

And down in my pockets, buried with the letters

You once wrote to me:

Extravagant & fraud, as they were

These artifices, artefacts that I own

out on the go

Veiling up the candid me, you, us, them-

For it to never been shown.
