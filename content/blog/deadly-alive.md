In the brim of darkness, I sat looking out 

Same day as before but not the same cloud 

I decided to speak to the one I lost

At last a chance had come from that ghostly house 

Entering the mansion they whispered eerily

Dead people's society, the walls said creepily 

I did not hesitate and waited for my turn

There were lots of fire which glowed when burnt

<html>

<br><br></html>

I walked into the chamber, with ceiling so high and the walls all narrow 

There was a back turned with a voice so shallow

Sit down 'It' hissed, “What brings you here?”

I told them I want to help in bringing the dead and alive near 

I begged him to associate, in this marvelous creation

That a boon this may be on this populous nation  

<html>

<br><br></html>

'It' gave me a chance to speak 

To the dead that lay ahead

Whom would I speak to, given a chance 

Would it be to whose death I led.  

<html>

<br><br></html>

I refused saying I don't know what ‘It’ meant

Sweat trailing down my forehead, as anxious beads of fear 

And the screams came back to me

Of the one I loved so dear 

Could I look across and see.

<html>

<br><br></html>

Oh those memories of that dark time returned, 

And 'It' told me to speak to the one.

I entered a chamber where people mourned

On a seat she sat with grace and beauty, now who looked like a nun

<html>

<br><br></html>

And she got me connected to him my friend who died in accident 

Who died young again

It was a cycle, for the life to get sucked by 

to cry over the repent.

<html>

<br><br></html>

"Hello there, it's been long.

Are you here to write your song?" 

"What song?" I asked.

With sadness my visage masked

<html>

<br><br></html>

He replied, “The one that death would appreciate 

The one that we both together would create!”

I told him he's mad, I told him we were kidding 

And drunk and bidding

And the car took his life

He Looked with those eyes and told me 

"It was your knife!"

I said, “Don't you blame for your death 

I will miss you till my last breath.”

And he looked and he peeked

At once he said, "The truth is all I seek."

<html>

<br><br></html>

I wondered what he hid under a cloak so long 

And all of sudden, his arms came out strong 

And he pinned and blamed me for his life

I did all I could to successfully survive.

<html>

<br><br></html>

The face was not of the man I knew 

Rather of a stranger with gleaming eyes 

He spoke a curse in Hebrew

All I could hear was strangers' cries.

<html>

<br><br></html>

I told him, “It was my duty to kill you, 

And yes I did it with my knife”

“You knew the secret of the devil's brew 

To be used for the gain of only your wife!”

<html>

<br><br></html>

An apple for the lost 

An orange for the pain 

A secret so bold

Not meant for the sane

In a lonely desert will you find the sand 

In the wintery night, you will find a hand

Trade him the apple, for you will seek the orange 

The world will heal, with your *NASB* syringe.

<html>

<br><br></html>

“You think you are so smart?!”

I started laughing in an eerie voice  

I am sure now that you are no more

You are no longer entitled a living being's choice

<html>

<br><br></html>

The ‘It’ slithered from behind and revealed its face 

Oh so you remember me my friend

I am none other than the winner of the devil’s race! 

Something I just couldn’t comprehend.

<html>

<br><br></html>

'It' was he and he was ‘It’

And all I could do was, bite my lip 

The righteous voice of mine cursed 

The ignited soul yet shone bright

I thundered with integrity

And claimed that I had committed murder I spoke with brevity

Despite what had endeavored.

<html>

<br><br></html>

I laughed and did not shiver, 

For I had murdered the sinner.

They hit me but I did not quite quiver 

In the eyes of truth

I seemed like a winner.

<html>

<br><br></html>

I was talking to the non-existing 

While my existence still mattered 

The dead people's society

Confirmed that his soul had shattered.

<html>

<br><br></html>

He laughed and laughed like there was no end

And suddenly shot towards me while my legs were still bent 

He lifted my head and whispered in my ear,

“Buddy there is no more fear.

I might know about the Devil's Brew. 

But you should know that,

You perished too!”
