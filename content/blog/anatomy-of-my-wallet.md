A worn-out brown wallet with the WRANGLER<html>&reg;</html>

logo embossed on the left flap, fading into pattern 

like skin folded around knuckles.

Creased currency bills carefully aligned with 

the wallet spine like an open book.

Ten-rupee coins no one in the city accepts.

There are identification cards I've always thought of 

as answer keys for policemen in case of a fatal accident.

A folded thirty-minute conversation 

had in secrecy during math class on notebook paper; 

a broken cocoon doodle space 

from when her sunflower smile convinced 

the caterpillars in my stomach to turn 

into butterflies that soared in my arteries, 

floated into my wrists, and out of my pen, 

bleeding every color on paper that I could muster 

in response.

Bus tickets with the ink faded so the destination 

and time of departure are no longer readable,

Another scrap with guitar chords on one side, 

the calculation of my total score in the Joint Entrance Examination on the other.

Seven passport size photographs.

A hospital canteen receipt 

bearing the last words of my grandfather to me, 

written in a shaky script, meant with a firm stance.
