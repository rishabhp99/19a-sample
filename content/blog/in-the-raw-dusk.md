+++

In the raw dusk, giving a sepia tone 

I shut my eyes close tight. 

To dream if I was born in the time of mighty people, 

Whose knowledge would give societies a path to walk on, 

Whose strength and valour would trigger even the weakest hearts to fight. 

Who is obsequious would lay foundation to a society. 

Yes, I crave to be a part of existence, 

Where even the trivial matters are sorted out in open justice. 

But in this existence,  

With white light forming the darkest of shadows,

To all the wrong answers in persistence, 

With inlaying of many textures of hardness, would form your real core. 

Where your characteristics would be masked by variants of the same colour. 

In that land, where a mask of a chakra 

Is gleaming over the spoke of a wheel!

Where concentric circles of math will form your war, 

This would then, not be a movies reel. 

Where even I beneath all the layers of oak, sandalwood, timber-

Cannot see your real form. 

Where the soldier on one knee,

Will become an archer’s norm. 

The string of ivory from the elephant’s tusk, which you ride on 

Will not help the masked man, to remove his painful thorn. 

Horses and chariots exist in peace, 

Where only pride and wives were on lease! 

My eyes open wondering where I am. 

Is this present right or the history a sham? 

I bend my head in his presence to pay him homage,

Some have their reasons to do so, while others have their rage.
