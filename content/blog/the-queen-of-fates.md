Royal by blood:

I hear them whisper-

Eyeing the crown that sat

Upon my cranium;

“Fate- that’s what made her”,

Undeserved- and synonyms such

Speaking loudly through their silent

Stares.

It’s the hidden beauty that rivals those of

Aphrodite; paper crowns-

Here and there.

Paper cuts is what caused

My Father to be six feet below-

Poisoned by his very own

The most loyal.

The deceiver.

Unforeseen was the

Weight that sat upon my head at the

Age of 16;

My tears were as good as foibidden-

For I,

had a queendom to

take care of.

Though the realm may not see

Me as their protector-

However insignificant may be my

Knowledge;

They were- are my People.

Thrown at me by

The cosmos,

Was this an opportunity or a trap-

Or one disguised as the other-

Knew I not.

“You can’t read your way through becoming a Queen”,

they say-

You just become one.

By choice, or by fate.

“Leo, u sure about this” River asked him holding her hand. “Yes, I am. She killed your father and you still are confused about this.”

“I don’t know what to say, she might be my stepmother but still she is my…”

“Hold your tongue, how can you even lend your voice to that bitch who killed her husband.”

“But I’m not sure…”

“You saw it with your own eyes, what else do you require… a confession? “ Leo’s voice was getting louder with each passing moment. It felt like he thrived on the idea of vengeance. “But, how do you plan to expose her? “ “Expose, are you joking? “Saying this, he pulled out his sword.

“I’m going to kill her.”

“No…wait”

“Listen the queen of Trance can’t be a weakling. You have to become stronger and braver just like your father.”

“I…” before she could begin speaking, tears engulfed her eyes. She covered her eyes so that no one would see her. Leo pulled off her hands that were covering her face and looked into her eyes. “This isn’t my River, this is not the brave girl I had fallen in love with…Hold yourself together. The coronation ceremony is tomorrow. I’ll be there tomorrow in the court with my dad. If you ever feel lost look at me, my eyes would tell you what to speak. .”

“Really, what are you magician…” Before she could complete, Leo’s lips were on hers.

“Yes I’m your magician and I always will be.” River held her hand; with her blushing cheeks she asked him,” Can you marry me tomorrow?”

“What!”

“Leo, I maybe a 16 year old but I know what life is. I know you love me and I feel you are a better king than me.” Leo was taken back. He didn’t see this coming. He bent on his knee and said,” I will be honoured Your Majesty”. River blushed again. She grabbed him by his collar and kissed him. It was her moment. For the first time she felt happy, after her father’s death.

The coronation had gotten over. Leo got married to the queen of Trance. Though it was a real and astonishing decision by a 16 year old, it wasn’t much of a surprise since the king himself had proclaimed that Leo was a promising suitor for his daughter. “River, it’s time to get this done.” “Leo I have prepared this note as you said” saying this River passed the parchment to Leo. “You sure this will work.”

“I’m going to give this to that bitch an…”

“Can you please call my stepmother, Elsa at least for once? “

Leo sighed. It was not something that had to be argued over.” Ok, I will. Listen I will try asking her for help and ask her to come near the pool. I have passed the message to the guest as well. “

“Already…” asked River looking around. He was telling the truth. All the faces around did have a mixture of curiosity and surprise present on them. This was the time for people to know the truth. She headed toward the pool and stood by the side holding a glass in her hand, waiting for the moment. “River…”

“That voice, it has to be her,” she said to herself and turned around. It was indeed Elsa.

“River, what are you doing?”

“Can’t you see, I’m going to drink this poison and die? “

“Are you out of your mind,” Elsa roared at her face. River noticed Leo standing behind the door waving at her. ’ This has to be the signal ‘she thought to herself and began her act.

“You killed my father, didn’t you?” The question startled Elsa “I know you did this. “

“Child you have misunderstood me”

“Go fuck yourself” saying this she drank the whole glass and went down on the ground. Her whole body shivered in pain. “I guess secrets can’t be maintained for eternity. Yes, I did kill your father and intended to kill you as well. But by marrying that boy, you did give me a headache.” Elsa said grinning.

“Why you bitc..” River fell down. “Guess, you made my work easy,” Elsa smirked.

“I’m sorry to interrupt you but I don’t think you should thank anyone just yet.” The voice came from behind a startled Elsa. She started trembling. It was Leo’s voice.

River got up,” Yes, we got you now lady”, she exclaimed.

“It was a trap!”

“Yes, Leo had assembled the guests around here behind those curtains to witness your confession, you are dead now.”

Leo clapped from behind and walked towards them.

“My love your acting has impressed me. Now that we have eliminated the fake Queen, let’s rule this kingdom as a king and queen.”

Leo suddenly stopped near Elsa and kept his hand on her face. Elsa stopped trembling. “You did really well, my queen” as he uttered this words he grabbed Elsa by her waist and kissed her lips.

River dropped the glass on the floor,” No this can’t be ….what in the name of God is going on!!” River fell on her knees with fear.

“You, bastard.” Leo stopped kissing and looked her with a villainous smile.

“Come on, how naïve are you? You couldn’t figure this out”. Now that Leo mentioned it, it did feel odd to River that everything went as planned perfectly. “And you thought I will love a girl like you when I have a beautiful maiden beside me, “ he pulled Elsa closer to him.

“ You, disgusting creature. I going to tell the ministers. Don’t forget I’m still the queen. “

But River couldn’t get up. Her body felt heavy. Leo looked at her with pity .

“I did switch the glass. So you did drink real poison and will die a death like your father did. With this parchment I will convince the court and yes, thanks for making me the king. I wanted to express my gratitude”.

He gave that cruel smile again. ”And before you die do watch your stepmother and your husband kissing their hearts out. Do see what real love is” . River closed her eyes in pain.’ I don’t want to watch this, no I can’t. It is better to die. I….’

The poison worked and she breathed her last. People called her Queen of Fates but little did they know she was just Pawn of Power.
