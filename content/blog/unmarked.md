Time & again, he sheds numerous skins

Bidding farewell, to the people he’d once been.

Humbly placing them, all in neat cartons

Some, he buries alive. 

Co-founding a band: the tragic gardens.

His attic, jam-packed; a cemetery of hoaxes & glory

Is that where they sleep, the corpses of fake-forgotten stories?

<html><br></html> 

Resting in the middle, is the box he left unmarked

Unnamed, it lies, so he can easily talk

Of all that happened; but more**,** of what could not;

(An if, an almost)

Cautious, he tries to hide

For they mention his frenemy, fondly called hurt.

“There has to be a way!”, is all he cries for**-**

Choosing to ignore it, is by now a long-lost war.

To care about the cuts,

But not invite the pain

Albeit, if I break again: whom shall I blame?

<html><br></html>

Beautifully broken? A mere felony.

A heartfelt allegation, to him

For what’s shattered maybe fixed,

Torn, perhaps be stitched. But his pieces that fell,

Were all slowly picked up, alone by himself

Leaving his hands ,head and heart:

All of it and more

everything; but Unmarked.
