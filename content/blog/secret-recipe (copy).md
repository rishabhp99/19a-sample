Weary, defeated- all at their peaks.

Trying to move forward: with mountains, 

Weighing down those shoulders. 

He then heaves a heavy breath; now, by my side

"You, are so brave, & quiet," I slowly describe:

"At times I overlook, you're suffering too." 

A deafening silence, before he attempts a smile 

"Tell me something I don't already know." 

Hence, I begin to outline: an old-forgotten recipe of mine

 Secretly handed down to me, in frightful times. 

About the only kind of falling- devoid of any hurting(s). 

I narrate to him a saga, of kindness: for oneself 

For in being tender to everyone, you often forget yourself.

 So let self-love, be your only safeguard 

Allowing the gloom from around, to be served as soil & holy ground 

For only then, shall you grow: grow from the dirt you were left in 

& begin plant your roots, blooming into the light, ever soft. 

It is a procedure, you see. A rather long, long one 

Though it is okay if you are late, most of us are

 For the only key here, is the key to at least start

 Start somehow; so, when I someday ask, 

To, "Tell me something I do not already know,

" It is your name you shyly take, as your first true-lover. 

Now would not that be beautiful to sight? To above all else, 

Having made a heart, that was finally proud of itself.
